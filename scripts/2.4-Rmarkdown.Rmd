# Diamonds

Here's a little example of RMarkdown used in the [R4DS book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html):

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only `r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

# Rmarkdown format recipes

## Text formatting

*italic* or *italic* **bold** **bold** `code` superscript^2^ and subscript~2~

## Headings

# 1st Level Header

## 2nd Level Header

### 3rd Level Header

## Lists

-   Bulleted list item 1

-   Item 2

    -   Item 2a

    -   Item 2b

1.  Numbered list item 1

2.  Item 2. The numbers are incremented automatically in the output.

<!-- You can comment and uncomment them by highlighting them all just like with code in an R script by typing *Command+Shift+C* -->

# Exercise

1.  "Knit" this document as an html file

2.  Toggle between the *Source* and *Visual* editors. How do they differ from the "knitted" document?

3.  Create a new Rmarkdown file using `File > New File > R Markdown...`. Play around with editing the template:

-   Add an author to the document
-   Change `{r pressure, echo=FALSE}` in the second chunk to `{r pressure, echo=FALSE, }` and use tab completion to explore the other options available.
-   Change the figure height and width in that same chunk.

4. Open the `Diabetes.Rmd` file in the `scripts` folder of this project.

# Knitting vs. R Markdown "Notebooks"

A normal R Markdown file has a "knit" button at the top. When we click this, all of the chunks are run and the output is produced in whatever format we specified. Knit is to R Markdown as Source is to an R script (i.e. run all lines). This makes it fairly reproducible, as long as the input data remains the same.

An R Markdown "Notebook" can be created with `File > New File > R Markdown Notebook`. This is a special type of R Markdown file which creates an output based only on the code that has currently been run. This could be useful in principal for small projects, but is much less reproducible. I advise that you stick with normal R Markdown files.
